### 2025-11-08: Initial Replit Setup
- Installed Python 3.11
- Created `server.py` with cache-control headers and port reuse
- Fixed all hardcoded URLs from jasminadenner.com to relative paths
- Configured workflow to run on port 5000
- Set up deployment configuration for production

## Important Notes

### URL Fix
All HTML files originally contained hardcoded URLs pointing to jasminadenner.com. These have been replaced with relative paths (e.g., `/assets/...`) to work properly in the Replit environment.

### External Dependencies
The website references:
- Google Tag Manager (analytics)

### Cache Control
The server is configured to disable browser caching during development to ensure changes are immediately visible. This is important because Replit shows the website in a nested iframe.

## Maintenance

### Adding New Content
1. Edit HTML files directly or use Pinegrow
2. Place any new assets in the appropriate `/assets/` subdirectory
3. Ensure all URLs are relative (not absolute)
4. Restart the workflow to see changes

### Troubleshooting
- If changes aren't visible: Check that the workflow is running and restart it
- If assets don't load: Verify URLs are relative paths, not absolute URLs
- If port conflicts occur: The server includes `allow_reuse_address = True`

## User Preferences
- All content must be related to Sirens company only
- No external credits or references in footer
- Home links should direct to main page (/)
